1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,880
Джозеф назвал её самой правильной книгой

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,460
на земле. Для Святых последних дней.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,350
Книга Мормона -- это ключевой камень

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,990
нашей религии. Её появление -- это

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,440
замечательная история. Сегодня мы присоединимся

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
к учёным, которые делятся открытиями, которые

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,910
они подчерпнули из бумаг Джозефа.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,912
...

9
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:23,000
Итак в 1826 году Джозеф получил указание

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,820
от ангела, представьте себе.
Это и многое другое

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,250
вы можете узнать на канале
"Бумаги Джозефа Смита".

00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,820
Телеканал КейДжаз в сотрудничестве с

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,320
департаментом церковной истории Церкви

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,080
Иисуса Христа святых последних дней

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,670
представляет этот еженедельных сериал, освещающий

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,290
исследования учёных и историков

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,080
подготовленные ими для публикации в

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,140
проекте "Бумаги Джозефа Смита" и я, ваш

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,370
ведуший Гленн Росси.

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,810
Джозеф Смит считал появление

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,970
книги Мормона чудесным

23
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,430
событием, новым откровением, которое,
как он сказал,

24
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,640
откроет глаза миллионов и сделает

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,460
прямым старые пути. Итак, как и

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,220
с Первым видением, есть и другие свидетельства,

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,660
описывающие появляение Книги Мормона,

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,210
которые дополняют историю и обогащают

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,510
подробности из разных источников и

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,630
ситуаций. Наши учёные сегодня возьмут

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,700
историю там, где мы прервались,

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,130
на Первом видении и проведут нас до

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,350
публикации Книги Мормона. Мы

34
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,979
начнём с доктора Ларри Портера, стоящего на

35
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,070
холме Кумора.
Джозеф сказал: "Я

36
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,729
продолжал трудиться и исполнять свои ежедневные

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,810
обязанности" и это заключалось в том, что он

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,700
помогал своего отцу в работах

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,590
на ферме -- обработке земли и накоплению благосостояния -

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,140
и быть доступным в качестве ежедневного помощника.

41
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,920
Но его разум никогда не покидала мысль

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,490
"Каково моё положение перед Господом"

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,180
Мы верим, что прошедшие три

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,330
с половиной года

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:12,950
были для него временем взросления

46
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,510
для той роли, которая была предназначена

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,790
ему.
Это желание знать своё

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,130
положение перед Богом привело

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,410
Джозефа к искренней молитве в 1835 году.

50
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,209
Оливер Каудери написал статью

51
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,100
для церковного периодического издания "Посланник

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,380
и адвокат". В этой статье

53
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,660
Оливер описывает произошедшее как раз

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,350
перед тем появлением Морония воскресной ночью

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,300
21 сентября 1823 года, так, как Джозеф

56
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,120
ему поведал о нём.

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,510
Перед отходом ко сну

58
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,400
разум нашего брата был необычайно взволнован

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,890
предметов, которым он так долго

60
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,010
нагружал его. Его сердце выплеснуло это

61
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,549
в искренней молитве и свя его душа была

62
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,870
настольно далека от всего временного

63
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,849
что мир потерял своё влияние на него

64
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,030
и всё, чего он желал - это подготовиться

65
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,920
сердцем, чтобы получить какое-то

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,239
послание. Со временем его семья заснула

67
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,129
и он начал соблюдать тишину,

68
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,650
чтобы остальный могли отдохнуть

69
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,189
от своих трудов. Он забылся в

70
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,989
быстром сне, но покой скоро закончился.
Если кого-то

71
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,150
интересуют условия

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,099
в хижине той ночью,
circumstances in the cabin that night

73
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,239
когда молился Джозеф, доктор Портер описывает:

74
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,930
Он был в бревенчатом доме и
he's in the the log home and there's

75
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,150
там было не очень много места, и

76
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,979
по этому бревенчатому дому

77
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:57,949
он пробрался между кроватями

78
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:01,129
осторожно, чтобы не разбудить

79
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,919
тех, кто отдыхает

80
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,900
и вот он открывает всю свою душу

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,449
своему Небесному Отцу.
Историк

82
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,150
Стивен Харпер, используя первое свидетельство

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,269
Джозефа, записанное в 1832 году выбирает

84
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,579
историю и указывает, что это

85
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,030
былна та ночь, которая так сильно запечатлелась

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,250
в разуме Джозефа.
Через три с половиной года после

87
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,710
Первого видения, Джозеф встал на колени

88
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,990
у своей кровати, чтобы попросить прощения. Он сказал, что

89
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,010
он опять подвергся каким-то грехам, и он знал

90
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,050
что он может получить прощение своих

91
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,510
грехов. "Я предался", говорит он, "согрешениям",

92
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,830
так, дайне мне убедиться, что я правильно читаю,

93
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,009
"и согрешил в многих вещах, что

94
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,030
нанесло моей душе раны,

95
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,070
и многое", говорит он, "из того,

96
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,380
что произошло, не может быть записано,

97
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,080
и семью моего отца преследовали",

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,030
говорит он, из-за его первого видения,

99
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,970
"и когда мне было 17 лет", кажется, я вижу именно

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,569
эти слова, "Я воззвал к Господу и Он

101
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:10,900
показал мне небесное видение, ибо вот

102
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,729
ангел Господний явился и

103
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,039
стоял передо мной, и это было ночью,

104
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,469
и он назвал меня по имени, и он сказал,

105
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:20,469
что Господь простил мои грехи, и он

106
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,229
открыл мне, что есть книга",

107
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,780
книга Мормона, как мы сейчас знаем,

108
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,060
"сокрытая в захоронении в холме", вы видите,

109
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,759
кажется, слово "захоронение", вот здесь,
the word perhaps right there engravings

110
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,729
"которая была сохранена Моронием

111
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,919
и его отцом", говорит Джозеф, и Мороний сказал

112
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,750
что "я должен пойти и взять эти писания,

113
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,389
что это пластины, и что они сокрыты в холме",
который Мороний

114
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,150
открыл Джозефу Смиту "и он открыл

115
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,949
мне многое, относящееся

116
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,620
к обитателям земли, что было открыто

117
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,889
с того времени. Джозеф пошёл

118
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,650
на холм, ожидая, что он получит пластины,

119
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,840
так что, можете представить себе его удивление,

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,060
когда ему было запрещено их брать, наверно

121
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,210
на тот момент он понятия не имел, что пройдут

122
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,300
четыре года, прежде, чем ему позволят

123
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,560
взять записи.
Мороний, который, как вы

124
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,680
знаете, при жизни был пророком, который

125
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,509
запечатал эти пластины и положил их

126
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,520
там для Джозефа, знаете, ни за что он не
there for Joseph there's no way he's

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,710
отдаст эту священную запись в руки того,

128
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,719
в ком он не имеет достаточно уверенности,

129
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,419
он даже разговаривает с Джозефом в самой

130
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,960
книге Мормона и Мороний

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,129
определяет, что Джозеф Смит не получит

132
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,319
в своё распоряжение эти

133
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,830
пластины, пока он не способен, способен

134
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,180
преодолеть захватывающие

135
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,520
искушения, с которыми он столкнётся, способен
temptations he'll face capable of

136
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,699
выдержать давление и преследование,
bearing up under the oppression the

137
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,550
с которыми он столкнётся.

138
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,379
Кое-что случилось в тот первый день

139
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,719
на холме, из-за чего Моронию пришлось запретить

140
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,240
Джозефу взять пластины. В своём свидетельстве

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,900
1832 года Джозеф рассказывает,

142
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,150
что случилось. "Трижды", он говорит,

143
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,779
"я пытался достать их, и меня

144
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,969
охватывал страх", он говорит, так что, три раза

145
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,789
в тот первый день на холме Джозеф

146
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,529
Смит пытается достать пластины из

147
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,810
ящика. Он не может, и он испуган.

148
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,909
"И я воззвал к Господу

149
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,819
в агонии моей души" -- Джозеф, если

150
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,119
вы заметили, пылкий рассказик,

151
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,830
когда вы читаете дневники Джозефа,

152
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,629
которые он пишет лично, они всегда

153
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,939
намного более эмоциональны, намного более пылки..

154
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,969
он очень выразителен

155
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,219
...он глубоко чувствовал
Это было

156
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,949
очень тяжело для Джозефа, и он там

157
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,389
взывает к Господу в агонии

158
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,529
своей души, "почему я не могу взять эту книгу.

159
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,169
и вот, появился ангел", говорит он, "
behold the angel appeared he says and

160
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,740
мне снова, и сказал:

161
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,550
Ты не соблядал заповедей Божьих,

162
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,719
которые я дал тебе, так что, ты

163
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,089
не можешь взять книгу." Смотрите, когда

164
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,800
Мороний навещал его в последний раз ночью,

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,319
он сказал, что ты не можешь взять

166
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,419
пластины для своего обогащения, не можешь, ты должен

167
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,429
остерегаться искушения, есть две цели,

168
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:02,229
ради которых ты не можешь получить пластины,

169
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,169
это стать известным, и стать богатым,

170
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:06,849
так что, когда Мороний появляется на следующий день,

171
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:08,830
он обращает особое внимание на этот момент

172
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,929
с жаждой славы либо денег. Тут

173
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:12,939
стоит остановиться

174
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:13,959
на несколько минут.

175
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,610
Joseph Smith's no more prone to

176
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,069
covetousness and anybody else but his

177
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,229
family owes a hundred all our cash

178
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:22,719
mortgage payment on their farm at the

179
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,119
end of every year and everybody in the

180
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,129
Smith family is very very conscious of

181
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,680
that and it's a difficult thing for them

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,659
he works awfully hard as his brothers

183
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,149
and sisters and mom and dad do to try to

184
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,519
raise that money and you can imagine I

185
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,380
hope you can imagine that that a stack

186
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,049
of gold in a hill nearby would have at

187
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,259
least more meanings in it

188
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,689
- Joseph then then the sacred meaning to

189
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,699
Moroni intense right let's summarize

190
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:51,339
what does Joseph Smith know when he's

191
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,040
done on the hill that first day he knows

192
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,139
that he's supposed to come back one year

193
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,360
from that time and talk tomorrow night

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,670
again and get more instructions it's

195
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,500
clear it's very clear from the early

196
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,290
sources from the this book from Joseph's

197
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,529
1835 36 journal from Joseph's mother's

198
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,680
memoir that the Smith family including

199
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,889
Joseph believes that if Joseph will meet

200
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,589
the angels conditions that he can have

201
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,639
the book in 1824 so imagine that it's

202
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,149
just a much richer picture much more

203
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,470
exciting

204
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,180
Cory Joseph snot thinking hole it'll be

205
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,830
four years four years to a teenager's a

206
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,230
long time he's thinking it'll be next

207
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,120
year and I know I can get them next year

208
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,480
I know what I did wrong in 1823 and so

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,740
in accordance with maroney's

210
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,670
instructions

211
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,010
Joseph returns to Cumorah September 22nd

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,830
1824 now remember the over the course of

213
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,840
this last year his oldest brother Alvin

214
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,930
had passed away leaving Joseph with the

215
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,440
charge to be a good boy and obtained the

216
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,900
record the second time he goes to the

217
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,110
hill 1824 he hopes to get them and in

218
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,720
fact we know from his mother's account

219
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,060
Joseph is more terse in his various

220
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,100
accounts but his mother tells us that he

221
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,480
gets the plates out of the hill actually

222
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,300
and turns to bring them home and then

223
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,950
sets them down Joseph Knight also

224
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,250
corroborates this story and it's it's at

225
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,290
that point that Joseph thinks I know the

226
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,780
ruins told me I can't use the plates for

227
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,990
my personal wealth or fame but there's

228
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,540
other things in there that might be

229
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,640
beneficial in those ways so he has these

230
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,190
motives again that Moroni says to him as

231
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,740
he as he mentions here that he joseph

232
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,750
has to have an i single to the glory of

233
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,610
God you can see those words right there

234
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,160
and whenever Joseph doesn't then Marilla

235
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,980
is always there to hold him accountable

236
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,200
so he puts the plates down to cover up

237
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,990
the box when he turns to get them again

238
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,240
they're gone and he's horrified he's

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,790
horrified he kneels to pray ask the Lord

240
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,580
where they are and Moroni comes and

241
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,070
explains to him why the plates are gone

242
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,960
why he can't have them Joseph's greatly

243
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,540
relieved he opens the box again and

244
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,880
there are the plates he reaches in to

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,790
get them and he's hurled backwards he

246
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,220
goes home weeping for grief and

247
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,560
disappointment his mother says did you

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,220
get them

249
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,590
Joseph's seniors asking no father I

250
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,450
could not take them well I would have

251
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,250
got them if I were in your shoes he says

252
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,950
father you don't know what you say the

253
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,630
angel of the Lord would not let me and

254
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,240
you can just feel that the spirits of

255
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,060
the Smith family fall Joseph comes home

256
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,430
weeping worried about whether his family

257
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,620
will continue to believe him or not and

258
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,450
it's a really powerful account

259
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,080
now the 1825

260
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,850
visit we know nothing about except

261
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,420
Joseph infers that it happens in several

262
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,720
different accounts but none of the

263
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,060
historical sources tell us any detail by

264
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,390
the time Joseph returns to the hill in

265
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,760
1826 the Smith family have lost their

266
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,180
farm we do know that in 1826 according

267
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,920
to Joseph Knight Joseph gets an

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,620
ultimatum that the personage which told

269
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,540
him if he would do right according to

270
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,360
the will of God he might obtain the

271
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,730
plates on the 22nd day of September next

272
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,230
that is in 1827 and if not he would

273
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,080
never get them he would not have them so

274
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,990
in 1826 Joseph has an ultimatum from the

275
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,000
angel imagine that a little pressure

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,680
indeed indeed and so he rises to it he

277
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,930
measures up to it this is a remarkable

278
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,240
thing about Joseph I I don't believe in

279
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,910
a flawless Joseph Smith Joseph Smith

280
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,010
didn't believe in a flawless Joe Smith I

281
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,040
love that about Joseph Smith so here he

282
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,800
is struggling with the teenage struggles

283
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,660
that we all do plus a little added

284
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,340
pressure from a messenger sent from the

285
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,930
presence of God who's holding him to a

286
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,980
very high standard of of thinking purely

287
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,560
having right motives before God also the

288
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,130
moral strength not just the the will to

289
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,720
do it but Joseph's got to have the

290
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,300
capacity to even the physical strength

291
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,930
to carry this very difficult project off

292
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:12,580
by September 22nd 1827 Joseph has now

293
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,070
married Emma Hale and they've moved back

294
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,960
to Manchester to live with Joseph's

295
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,160
family Joseph went to Cumorah just after

296
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,250
midnight to avoid his enemies Emma went

297
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,920
with him my mother Smith said that she

298
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,780
said I played as her work brother press

299
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,240
upon her hand and finally around

300
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,150
midnight Emma came through in her riding

301
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,210
dress with Joseph and accompanied him to

302
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,930
the hill in mr. Knights wagon when

303
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,320
Joseph went up on the hill and there met

304
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,240
with the angel for final instructions

305
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,480
he told him that yeah if he would

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,019
protect the plates and see to the work

307
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,209
that he had been commissioned that the

308
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,029
angel would protect him he receives the

309
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,009
plates from the angel he buries the

310
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,809
plates in the woods he leaves him in a

311
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,910
hollow log he says but he brings back

312
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,949
within the seer stone so we call Urim

313
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,649
and Thummim that morning he comes for

314
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,050
breakfast with his father and joseph

315
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,449
night and some time that morning he gets

316
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,899
Joseph snide aside and Joseph puts his

317
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,720
head in his hands like this and and says

318
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,309
according to these lines here on the

319
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,369
bottom of the page I am so disappointed

320
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,709
now nobody's dared hardly even broach

321
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,480
the subject at this point you know did

322
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,670
you get them where are they so he says I

323
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,040
am so disappointed and Joseph Knight

324
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,259
tries to console him well so everything

325
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,329
will be all right it's okay it's gonna

326
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,999
work out I am greatly disappointed

327
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:43,879
Joseph says and then we can almost see

328
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,800
the smile break across his face he can't

329
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,749
hold it any longer he says it is ten

330
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,309
times better than I expected

331
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,860
they are marvellous he says I can see

332
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,429
anything

333
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:55,519
speaking of of the Urim and Thummim that

334
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,009
first night then Joseph hid the plates

335
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,100
in the woods just off the hill but later

336
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,499
threats to the place caused Joseph to

337
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:05,929
return for them it was on that night if

338
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,269
you recall the story that he left the

339
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,249
road and went through the woods on

340
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,279
trails to avoid being seen now about

341
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,249
those trails Don Enders learned this

342
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,279
most fascinating detail I wondered about

343
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,100
those that pathway because a person just

344
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,529
wouldn't leave the road and walk into

345
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,230
the wilderness not being aware of where

346
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,759
he's going you don't do that in this

347
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:34,040
area we had a missionary couple on our

348
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,699
staff he was retired a lifetime of

349
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,610
service as an aerial photographer and we

350
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,269
got him to looking at some aerial

351
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,850
photography maps with us and said where

352
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,179
might such a trail have been and after a

353
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,639
few minutes of observing the aerial

354
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,399
photographs pointed his finger to it and

355
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,520
outlined it precisely

356
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,680
what we knew about it he was able to

357
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,820
show us a number of prehistoric trails

358
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,510
that cross through this area one that

359
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,980
left Tamura

360
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,340
area and there would have been than

361
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,400
others had extended to the southeast etc

362
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,880
but a particular path led Northwest it

363
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,460
actually crossed the Smith farm now for

364
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,470
any of you that are planning on going to

365
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,780
Kimora and looking for the stone box or

366
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,260
the place were buried think again

367
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,970
curious about that very thing Don

368
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,730
learned the following the data that I

369
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,000
have from my research efforts indicates

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,470
that farmer Robeson around 1910 was

371
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,020
getting a little bit disappointed and

372
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,960
disgusted that these Mormons who came to

373
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,230
this area Tramp '''l cramping across his

374
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,600
crops came up here to the hill so he put

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,580
up the sign saying no trespassing in

376
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,760
what was left he says of of the

377
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,450
depression which we surmise is not too

378
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,260
deep but he he filled in and so that was

379
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,800
obliterated in 1842 Joseph described the

380
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,500
plates as follows each plate was six

381
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,900
inches wide and eight inches long and

382
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,619
not quite so thick as common ten they

383
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,990
were filled with engravings in Egyptian

384
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,940
characters and bound together in a

385
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,670
volume as the leaves of a book with

386
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,640
three rings running through the hole the

387
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,040
volume was something near six inches in

388
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,380
thickness a part of which was sealed

389
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,980
it was now Joseph's responsibility to

390
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,740
translate a language that neither he nor

391
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,370
any other modern had ever seen before he

392
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,970
was 21 years old

393
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,430
josephs wondering now how do I translate

394
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,190
reformed Egyptian and we've I think

395
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,830
maybe assumed that it it's too it's so

396
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,840
very very simple you know you just well

397
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,970
doesn't he know how to do it well no he

398
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,550
doesn't Martin Harris takes evidently

399
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,220
some a piece of paper with some Book of

400
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,320
Mormon characters on it along with some

401
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,100
translations presumably a few few

402
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,990
are more that Joseph is translated he

403
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,610
goes to New York City where he visits a

404
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,130
renowned professor named Charles Anton

405
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,760
or Anton now Anton was everybody grants

406
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
one of the foremost scholars and

407
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,900
antiquities but there's really no way he

408
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,919
could have known these things I being a

409
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,299
professor I know how this goes

410
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,860
last thing on earth you want to do is

411
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,840
confess that you don't know everything

412
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,210
in the world but Anton would have been

413
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,190
better served if he said really I have

414
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,799
no idea I can't read those characters

415
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,830
that is the whole point and Joseph

416
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,780
didn't understand that at the beginning

417
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,520
he didn't send Martin Harris to New York

418
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,490
City to fulfill Isaiah chapter 29 but

419
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,830
it's after Harris comes back having had

420
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,860
Anton say I can't read a sealed book

421
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,710
it's after Harris comes back having had

422
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,690
that experience at some point that

423
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,080
Joseph sees himself as the unlearned

424
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
translator of Isaiah 29 what an

425
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,580
awakening that must have been just

426
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,020
imagine that for yourself

427
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,299
to be an obscure boy as Joseph called

428
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,000
himself and then to find yourself the

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,909
fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and in

430
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,799
any case Martin Harris comes back from

431
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,450
New York City more convinced than ever

432
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,669
that Joseph Smith is telling the truth

433
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,610
and he sits down for the next several

434
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,950
months now next few months and rights

435
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,289
for Joseph Smith as Joseph dictates

436
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,520
Paris scribes 116 pages and you may know

437
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,309
the story that results from that Harris

438
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,200
begs Joseph Smith to let him take those

439
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
pages up to his wife especially in

440
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,880
relatives in upstate New York and prove

441
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,470
to them that he's not an idiot

442
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,360
that he's not giving his money and time

443
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,390
to Joseph Smith for for a foolish

444
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,850
reasons and the letter book here if

445
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,280
Joseph Smith his first history tells how

446
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,159
that whole episode plays out we had

447
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,580
translated 116 pages and that he desired

448
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:13,020
to carry them to read to his to his

449
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,020
friends he wanted peradventure to let

450
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,409
see persuade them I think is the gist of

451
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,960
it of the truth therefore I inquire to

452
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,540
the Lord and the Lord said unto me that

453
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,659
he must not take them what we've some

454
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,000
time

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,690
thought is that that it's the Lord who

456
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,730
recognizes that he's made a mistake here

457
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,290
it's as if he says ho I was being a

458
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,150
little too hard on you I'm sorry about

459
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,710
that that's not what happened

460
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,490
he clearly expressed his will and then

461
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,260
they badgered him long enough till he

462
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,750
said do whatever you want go let him go

463
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,750
with them you know what I've said Joseph

464
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,000
tries to have it both ways and you can

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,950
try to imagine the predicament he's in

466
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,590
Harris is his benefactor he supplies the

467
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,320
money he does describing who's going to

468
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,420
help if Martin Harris leaves and Harris

469
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,820
almost to the point of saying well you

470
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,200
don't do what I'm asking you to do

471
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,080
Joseph you can forget my help so josephs

472
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,790
in a terrible predicament

473
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,320
well you know the story Martin Harris

474
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,660
takes the pages he loses them he never

475
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,940
does come back Joseph has to go up to

476
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,610
New York and find out there that Martin

477
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,380
Harris lost him this is a terrible

478
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,540
turning point a terrible and wonderful

479
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,130
turning point in Joseph Smith's life

480
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,960
initially he thinks he may be finished

481
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,570
as a Revelator I should say that when

482
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,240
Joseph gives the plate of the pages of

483
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,680
translated manuscript to Martin Harris

484
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,260
Moroni confiscates the plates and the

485
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,390
seer stones if Joseph is going to break

486
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,700
the commandments he's not going to be

487
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,590
the Lord's translator anymore or at

488
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,990
least it's he's suspended from doing so

489
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,330
when Harris doesn't come back Joseph

490
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,000
seriously worried and indeed when he

491
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,160
learns that the pages are lost he fears

492
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,830
that he's that's the last time that he's

493
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,110
going to disobey the commandments well

494
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,280
wonderful news

495
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,840
the Lord gives them a relation which is

496
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,670
one of the most beautiful of all

497
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,820
revelations section 3 of the Doctrine

498
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,430
and Covenants hinges it's 20 verses long

499
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,400
or so hinge is right in the middle after

500
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,070
the Lord has rebuked Joseph soundly in

501
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,380
the first half in the voice of a just

502
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,020
God right in the middle it says but

503
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,720
remember God is merciful therefore

504
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,550
repent of what now it's done and thou

505
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,960
art again called to the work

506
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,440
Joseph repents and that September he

507
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,570
gets the plates and the stones back

508
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,330
again and he can read so one year from

509
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,370
the day he first got them they're

510
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,940
returned to Joseph September of 1828 now

511
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,590
and he's ready to go again

512
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,450
but Martin Harris will never scribe for

513
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,350
Joseph F to the

514
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,870
from September of 1828 through the

515
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,140
winter to April of 1829 very little work

516
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,210
of translation is done in Joseph and

517
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,460
Emma's farm home in Pennsylvania the

518
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,850
effort seemed to be on survival what we

519
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,340
need then is a new scribe and Joseph

520
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,049
prays to the Lord and asked him to send

521
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,120
someone to help and in the spring of

522
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,850
1829 after having taught school in

523
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,470
Manchester New York where Joseph's

524
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,750
parents and siblings live Oliver Cowdery

525
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,480
comes down to Susquehanna Pennsylvania

526
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,669
to meet Joseph Smith having heard about

527
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:14,350
the Book of Mormon translation he's

528
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,880
accompanied by Joseph C younger brother

529
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,429
Samuel and he comes and arrives on the

530
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,130
fifth day of April 1829 on the seventh

531
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,840
day of April they start to write the

532
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,150
Book of Mormon we might wonder how it

533
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,880
was that Oliver was so certain of Joseph

534
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,070
and the work that he would change the

535
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,580
entire course of his life Ron Barney

536
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,640
quoting Joseph's 1832 history gives us

537
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,610
this amazing insight when Oliver had

538
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,280
determined to can't leave Palmyra and

539
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,659
come to harmony the Lord had appeared to

540
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,650
Oliver Cowdery and showed him what he

541
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,679
was doing with Joseph so that when

542
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,929
Oliver Cowdery got to harmony

543
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,090
Pennsylvania on April the 5th 1829

544
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,260
Joseph didn't have to convince him of

545
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,110
anything and it came to pass after much

546
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,500
humility and affliction of soul I

547
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,419
obtained them again when the Lord

548
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,030
appeared unto a young man by the name of

549
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,320
Oliver Cowdery

550
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,510
and showed unto him the plates in a

551
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,010
vision and also the truth of the work

552
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,870
one of the things that makes all inform

553
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,390
Souls Marvel in the translation of the

554
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,210
Book of Mormon is just how long it

555
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,750
actually took they wrote at a pace that

556
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,539
is staggering they start on the seventh

557
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:40,360
day of April 1829 on the 11th of June

558
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,400
having moved in the mean time from

559
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,950
Pennsylvania to New York they filed for

560
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,580
copyright and at the utica office of

561
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,440
lands mr. Lansing and obtained the

562
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,960
copyright we believe and all evidence

563
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,700
suggests they are finished with

564
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,820
translation by the end of June 1829 you

565
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,030
think about that Mesa are April seventh

566
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,640
end of June 1829 you've read The Book of

567
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,260
Mormon that's an impressive piece of

568
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,530
work and there is not any evidence in

569
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,810
the manuscript of redrafting of going

570
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,890
back a fixing of you know polishing not

571
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,740
any it seems in fact like a stream of

572
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,210
consciousness from beginning to end and

573
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,670
the original manuscript shows all the

574
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,650
evidence of being a dictation that is

575
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,450
there are errors in it there are the

576
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,120
errors of hearing they're there where

577
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,820
Oliver will write the word as he hears

578
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,950
it even if it's not just the right word

579
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,790
they're not the errors of a copyist and

580
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,100
so I think it's absolutely fascinating

581
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,990
that the original manuscript of the Book

582
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,840
of Mormon is itself probably it is

583
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,990
itself the most profound testimony that

584
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,090
the book is what Joseph says it is the

585
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,220
Book of Mormon is as a marvelous work

586
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,470
and one roots it's never been duplicated

587
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,320
it's the most remarkable book of which I

588
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,510
know it's the most self-conscious book

589
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,170
it knows exactly what it is it's it's in

590
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,200
so intentional its authors their point

591
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,150
to emphasize Christ and everybody who's

592
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,040
ever tried to duplicate it has has spent

593
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,980
as failed miserably and yet there are

594
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,110
lots of critics there's no shortage of

595
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,270
alternative explanations for the Book of

596
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,790
Mormon the interesting thing about every

597
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,800
one of them is that they have to deny

598
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,780
the historical record we looked at

599
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,240
several documents here today that assert

600
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,030
the story of the Book of Mormon coming

601
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,460
forth as Joseph Smith told it it's

602
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,700
verified by Joseph in variety of counts

603
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,430
it's also verified by other eyewitnesses

604
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,090
David Whitmer Oliver Cowdery Emma Smith

605
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,120
and others testified that Joseph told

606
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,790
the truth and so the point is and this

607
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,860
is a remarkable point everybody should

608
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,020
remember this and that is that those who

609
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,900
knew Joseph Smith best believed him most

610
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,310
I think about that okay those who knew

611
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,370
Joseph Smith best believed him most

612
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,560
Joseph Smith translated the Book of

613
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,850
Mormon by the power of God and the

614
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,530
people who knew him

615
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,660
knew him from the time he was born in

616
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,190
the case of his mother and father were

617
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,380
there in the house when he was doing it

618
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,970
in the case of Emma Smith had written

619
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,250
for him and said as much as a marvel to

620
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,430
me as to anyone else in in Emma's case

621
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,300
his wife's case it's remarkable now it's

622
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,580
left for all the world to decide whether

623
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,330
Joseph was telling the truth or lying I

624
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,830
wonder if in this modern age there ever

625
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,560
was so much that depended on one man's

626
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,990
integrity the Book of Mormon is

627
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,320
available every man can hold it he can

628
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,110
read it and he can decide for himself in

629
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,120
our next show we go to harmony

630
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,390
Pennsylvania it was there that Joseph

631
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,760
meets the woman who will become his wife

632
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,360
there was no wife stealing in the case

633
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,630
of Emma Smith a woman was a little aged

634
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,470
at 18 and needed no consent from her

635
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,410
father or anybody else about getting

636
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,230
married so when she married Joseph at

637
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,980
age 22 Isaac had no say in the matter

638
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,470
period to regret that and more next week

639
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,120
on the Joseph Smith papers

640
00:28:29,420 --> 00:00:00,000
